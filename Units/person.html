<!-- In CSS, % (percent) and px (pixels) are units of measurement used to define the sizes of elements, their spacing, and other dimensions. -->
<!-- Definition: A pixel is a fixed unit of measurement that corresponds to a single dot on a display screen.
Usage: Pixels are commonly used for defining fixed dimensions, such as width, height, padding, margin, font-size, etc.
Behavior: Since pixels are fixed units, they do not scale with the size of the viewport or parent elements. -->

<!-- Percentages (%)
Definition: A percentage is a relative unit of measurement that is based on the size of the parent element.
Usage: Percentages are often used for responsive designs, allowing elements to scale relative to their containing elements.
Behavior: The actual size of an element defined in percentages will vary depending on the size of the parent element. For example, if the parent element is 500px wide, a child element with width: 50% will be 250px wide.
